Battling mortal injuries and merciless weather, the survivors have only a few days to escape the icy elements. I just watched the movie for the first time in quite a while and felt like seeing what other people think we are shown at the end. I know the movie is based on a short story which might provide more detail as well. The wolf which, is the alpha is still breathing and we see Ottway's head laying on the wolf as if resting. (#spoiler) There are multiple ways to look at this. (#spoiler) Most likely, our main character is dead. But, possibly he has managed to kill the pack and hurt the alpha enoug.

The Grey: An oil drilling team struggles to survive after a plane crash strands them in the wilds of Alaska. Hunting them is a pack of wolves Saw this last night with a bud. I got the general feeling from the other people in the movie theater that it was a disappointment for them. I think they expected a happy ending and more action throughout the movie. I even got a few comments that the movie's plot was "slow to unfold" which I didn't find to be the case at all. I was constantly searching for the next screen or next attack footage like it was a horror movie. I thought it was a poetic story. Bellandi. An oil drilling team struggles to survive after a plane crash strands them in the wilds of Alaska. Hunting them is a pack of wolves that sees them as intruders. 
After narrowly surviving a deadly plane crash in the Alaskan wilderness, a band of oil riggers must fend for their lives in the ice and snow. But thanks to wolves that view their presence as a threat, they aren't alone. Following a grueling five-week shift at an Alaskan oil refinery, workers led by sharpshooter John Ottway (Liam Neeson) are flying home for a much-needed vacation. A brutal storm causes their plane to crash in the frozen wilderness, and only eight men (Frank Grillo, Dermot Mulroney), including. Wow. I was really blown away by the ending. I really didn't expect it to be anything like this. I can't be the only one that would give this movie a 10/10. What are your thoughts? http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1601913/. The scene after the plane crash where he tells the man he is going to die. wow. Unfortunately that was about all that impressed me. The rest of the movie seemed so horrifically unrealistic. Surviving a plane crash? Okay that can happen. Wolves popping out one at a time?. doesn't seem likely. Wolves somehow teleporting to the bottom of a 100 foot drop off a canyon to nomnomnom the guy who fell off the rope? Wtf. Swimming in a freezing river for several minutes, getting. 
Financial analysis of The Grey (2012) including budget, domestic and international box office gross, DVD and Blu-ray sales reports, total earnings and profitability. So this kind of blew me away. It absolutely was not the film I was expecting based on the trailer. It was harrowing and extremely moving at times, with some really surprisingly quiet scenes. Liam Neeson knocked it out of the park and at times seemed to be channelling his own personal loss into a heartbreakingly raw performance. Hard to watch, but brilliant.

The Grey - 5/10 Personally, I did not really notice nor care for what I did notice when it came to the "philosophical" element of this one. Truth be told, it felt like they were reaching to try and make what is a pretty typical survival drama hit home and be more profound than it truly is. Any claims to the contrary can be supported because, well, it's a survival drama. I see some reviews commenting on how this one is a study 
Flannery: Hey, guys, don't do that put your head between your knees crap if this plane crashes. There were rumours that the film was going to be re-released in a limited run to remind the academy that this film exists, so hopefully it happens as I feel that it was really the surprise hit of the year for me, in my opinion. The Grey is a film directed by Joe Carnahan and starring Liam Neeson, Dermot Mulroney, Frank Grillo. The build up to the ending of The Grey was epic in my mind. From "Liam" having thoughts and short acts of suicide, moving from his flashbacks of his wife's battle with sickness, the last survivors of the plane fighting to survive, and the alpha's showdown = EPIC. The soundtrack was masterful, acting textbook, and the screenplay left no holes. The more I think of this movie the more I like it.if you have seen the film, thoughts.
